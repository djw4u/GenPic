### Welcome.  GenPic and this page are still under construction. 

 

GenPic provides an automatic generator to create beautiful artwork and patterns for all kinds of use. 

Establish your own studio to produce digital art. 

Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.
